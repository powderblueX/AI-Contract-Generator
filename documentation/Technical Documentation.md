# Technical Documentation for Intelligent Contract Generation System

## 1. Project Overview
This project aims to implement intelligent contract recommendation and automatic generation. It integrates RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), embedding models, vector search, PyQt frontend, FAISS indexing, and contract template management to create an efficient, intelligent, and scalable contract generation and management system.

## 2. Core Technology Explanations

### 1. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- **Principle**: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) combines retrieval and generation. It first retrieves the most relevant contract templates through vector search, then performs intelligent analysis and content filling based on user input.
- **Implementation**: This project uses the SentenceTransformer embedding model to convert contract templates and user requirements into vectors, and utilizes FAISS for efficient similarity retrieval to recommend the most appropriate contract templates.
- **Advantages**: Improves recommendation accuracy and diversity while avoiding the hallucination problems of pure generative models.
- **Reason for Choice**: RAG balances knowledge coverage and generative flexibility, making it suitable for structured, constraint-intensive scenarios like contracts.

### 2. Embedding Model and Vector Retrieval
- **Model**: Uses HuggingFace's all-MiniLM-L6-v2 as the embedding model to convert text into high-dimensional vectors.
- **Retrieval**: FAISS is used to build vector indices for contract templates, enabling millisecond-level similarity retrieval.
- **Role**: Ensures high efficiency and scalability of recommendations.
- **Future Optimization Directions**: Can be replaced with larger models or those more optimized for Chinese to improve semantic understanding capabilities. (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 was selected here due to cloud server performance limitations during previous competitions)

### 3. Contract Recommendation and Generation Process
- **Recommendation**: After users input requirements, the system first analyzes the requirements using the embedding model, retrieves the most relevant contract templates, scores them based on multiple dimensions including contract type and features, and outputs a recommendation list.
- **Generation**: After users select a template, the system automatically extracts key information from the requirements and intelligently fills it into the placeholders of the contract template to generate a customized contract document.
- **Technical Details**:
  - Keyword extraction, requirement analysis, template matching, and placeholder filling each have independent modules for easy maintenance and extension.
  - Supports multiple contract types and templates with flexible template management.
- **Future Optimization Directions**:
  - In the contract recommendation section, the keyword description of contracts is particularly important and needs to be more detailed, comprehensive, and accurate.
  - Optimize keyword extraction models, such as selecting more specialized contract analysis models while improving prompt design to enhance generation quality.
  - Introduce contract classification mechanisms to automatically recommend contract templates of relevant categories based on user input content.
  - Optimize contract generation models, such as selecting more powerful text generation models while improving prompt design to enhance generation quality.

### 4. PyQt Frontend Interface
- **Features**: Provides complete interaction including contract type selection, template selection, requirement input, recommendation and generation buttons, progress bar, logs, and result tables.
- **Advantages**: User-friendly interface, easy to operate, suitable for actual business scenarios.
- **Reason for Choice**: PyQt supports complex desktop application development, is cross-platform, and easy to integrate. (PyQt is used here only as a way to provide a frontend interface demo)

### 5. FAISS Index and Knowledge Base Management
- **Role**: Establishes independent vector indices for each type of contract template to support large-scale retrieval.
- **Advantages**: Efficient, scalable, and convenient for subsequent template expansion.
- **Future Optimization Directions**: Performance can be further improved by combining ANN algorithms and distributed indexing.

### 6. Contract Template and Placeholder Management
- **Templates**: All contract templates are standard docx files with matching JSON placeholder definitions for easy automated filling.
- **Management**: Supports multi-level classification, batch import, and template extension.
- **Future Optimization Directions**:
  - Contract placeholder management: Placeholders are crucial for intelligent contract filling. It is difficult to directly improve the content and position of placeholders through large models; human design and replacement of positions requiring filling in initial documents are necessary. This workload is enormous, and attention must be paid to contract update issues. (Currently, only the "Custody Contract" has been completely filled manually; subsequent contracts will need placeholder content and positions improved based on contract updates.)

### 7. Large Models and API Calls
- **Usage**: Some information extraction and intelligent analysis can call large models.
- **Reason for Choice**: Enhances complex semantic understanding and generation capabilities.
- **Future Optimization Directions**: More powerful or cost-effective APIs can be switched according to business needs. Additionally, consideration can be given to AI Agent and MCP.

## 3. Model Features and Optimization Suggestions
- **Current Model**: all-MiniLM-L6-v2, small size, fast speed, suitable for general semantic retrieval.
- **Future Optimization Directions**:
  - Fine-tune embedding models for the contract domain.
  - Multi-model fusion to improve recommendation and generation effects in complex scenarios.
  - Introduce knowledge graphs and rule engines for assistance.

## 4. Architectural Advantages and Future Extensions
- **Modular design** for easy maintenance and feature expansion.
- **Supports multiple contract types and templates, making it easy to expand new businesses.**
- **Can interface with various application scenarios such as Web, API, and batch processing.**
- **Supports hot updates of models and indices.**

## 5. Summary
This project implements an efficient, intelligent, and scalable contract generation system through multiple technologies including RAG, embedding retrieval, intelligent recommendation and generation, and template automation. The system can continuously optimize models, algorithms, and system architecture according to business needs.
